analysis, interview question generation, and real-time sentiment analysis.

CV Analysis: The system analyzes candidate CVs to assess qualifications and suitability for specific roles.
Dynamic Question Generation: It generates personalized interview questions based on the candidate's 
background and the job's requirements, ensuring a tailored interview experience.

Real-Time Sentiment Analysis: While candidates respond, the system performs sentiment analysis on their 
answers, providing insights into their emotional tone and communication style.
Post-Interview Reporting: After the interview, the system generates a comprehensive performance report and 
sends it to the HR platform via webhook for further evaluation. Benefits: This system saves time, enhances 

objectivity in hiring decisions, and provides valuable insights into candidate suitability beyond just qualifications.

Maren Robotics
AI-Powered Surface Rescue System for Fasty Life-Sa

Ankara

I developed an AI-powered surface rescue system for Fasty, an autonomous rescue drone, using computer vision 
algorithms to detect and track humans and objects on the water's surface. The system sends real-time notifications for 

immediate response, ensuring faster emergency interventions. Additionally, the system identifies potential dangers, 
such as drowning incidents, by detecting abnormal movements and providing actionable alerts for intervention.

Object Detection: The system uses advanced computer vision algorithms to identify and track humans and objects 
on the water's surface.

Real-Time Notifications: Once a human or object is detected, the system immediately sends notifications to the 
relevant emergency response teams.

AI Integration: I integrated AI models into the drone's embedded system, enabling real-time decision-making and 
action.

Enhanced Safety: The system improves aquatic safety by identifying potential dangers and enabling quick 
intervention.

AIVA Tech

AIVA Meeting Speech Recognition System

Istanbul

This system is designed to capture and analyze spoken content during meetings in real-time. It converts spoken 
language into text using advanced speech recognition technology and then applies natural language processing (NLP) 

to identify key topics and individuals mentioned during the discussion. Based on this analysis, the system 
automatically generates actionable commands, such as creating meeting summaries, scheduling follow-up tasks, or 

triggering notifications for specific action items. This automation enhances meeting productivity by ensuring that 
critical points and decisions are captured accurately and promptly.

Real-Time Speech Recognition: Transcribes spoken words into text instantly to ensure no data is lost during the 
meeting.
Topic Extraction: Utilizes NLP algorithms to identify and highlight the main topics and discussion points.
Person Identification: Detects names and roles mentioned during the meeting, mapping out who is associated 

with each discussion point.
Automated Command Generation: Based on the identified topics and individuals, the system can automatically 
create commands such as calendar events, task assignments, or summary reports.
Seamless Integration: Easily integrates with existing workflows and tools (e.g., email, calendar, project 
management systems) to streamline post-meeting follow-ups.
